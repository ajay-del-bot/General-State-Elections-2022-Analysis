# General-State-Elections-2022-Analysis
A prediction model to predict the winners of Indian State Elections, 2022

## PROBLEM DEFINITION
Building a classification model to predict the popularity of Indian political parties on social media and infer their chances of winning the upcoming State Elections-2022, by utilizing the sentiment analysis of Twitter data.

## SCOPE
1. The proposed system will help to classify the twitter data, related to political parties contesting in the upcoming elections, into positive, negative and neutral tweets. This data, essentially, summarizes the general sentiment of people. 
2. Depending on the percentage of positive tweets over a period, along with the volume of tweets, we can roughly predict the percentage of seats that can be won by a particular political party. 
3. Classic machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest are used to effectively improve the prediction accuracy and stability.

## MOTIVATION
* There was an 87% increase in the usage of social media in India during the lockdown.
* As of July 2021, India has 22.1 million active Twitter users and 18% of them look at this social media platform as a source of news. 
* 2020-21 saw an increase in people taking a stand against problems everyone had traditionally stayed away from before. These topics include politics, social injustice, mental health, and so on.
* Majority of political parties in India see this platform as a way to understand the view of the general public towards issues currently happening in India. 
* Thus, it becomes important to analyze the sentiment of people during election periods, so that authorities can get a better view of their decisions and accordingly improve their current status.


## INTRODUCTION

* Sentimental Analysis is a method to teach a machine to extract emotion from a given text. A text can be anything, a simple review, a social statement, tweets or messages.
* Social Media has become a powerful tool to share one’s views. It has provided strong mediums such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+ to share opinions, reviews, and ratings
* Tweets regarding elections can be analyzed and sentimental analysis can be performed on them to calculate their polarity and further predict election results.
* The Indian states contesting elections in 2022 are Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur, with the main one being in UP, where it is conducted on 403 seats. Election outcomes based on Twitter poll has been observed to be effective for a long electoral process in India.

## FUTURE SCOPE
* Currently, the proposed system does not consider geographical location of the tweet as a filter for state elections, as Twitter does not provide adequate information about user’s location, thus, a general mood of entire blogosphere is considered to predict the election results. 
* This work can further be extended on tweets of different regional languages of Indian states other than English to improve accuracy. Along with machine learning models, deep learning models can be integrated and compared to further improve the accuracy of the model.
